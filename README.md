# Timoshenko_FiniteElement
Deflections and vibrations of Timoshenko beam (Finite Element Method)

In this project deflection and vibrations of the Timoshenko beam are investigated using the Finite Element Method (FEM). In the beginning, the generalities and importance of the beam and equations governing the problem, as well as the description of the solution method and algorithm are given. To validate the Python code written in this project, the GDQ method, commercial finite element software (ANSYS) and existing valid article were used.
